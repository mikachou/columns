# Columns

This is a (light!) reimplementation of Megadrive/Genesis game Columns in Borland Pascal. This project was created when I studied programming in university institute of technology in 2008-2009.

I'm not sure that it still works good. It works on my machine using Linux Mint 19.3 and wine. To play the game you must launch "columns.exe" - eventually with wine if played on Linux.

Here is what I see (and what is supposed to be seen!) when I launch the game :

Push space bar to launch a game and pause it, then use arrow to move the pieces on the screen. Push up arrow to change jewels order on falling stack.

Sounds might not work (?), you can eventually push S-key to switch sounds On/Off.
